# DataStructAlgo

We were tasked to code a program for a robot that helps to deliver parcels from the HOME
position to 3 other positions in a hospital. There are different paths our robot can
take. There are sequential tasks that our user supposedly inputs into the program,
starting with the pickup destination and then the drop off destination. 
Distance between locations are stored in the text file that we created, and using this text file, we
are supposed to find the shortest distance for the robot to travel to pick up and drop off
parcels.
In this particular scenario, we assumed that the robot would pick up all the parcels at once
from all the stations and then drop off all the parcels at once at the respective stations, and it
would finally return home after dropping off all the parcels.
